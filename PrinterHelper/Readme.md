My computer doesn't want to fully communicate with my printer, which makes two sided printing slightly tedious.

To do it I'll have to print every uneven page, flip the stack around, and then print even pages.

It was annoying to have to write the numbers myself every time, especially on larger documents.

That's when I decided to write a quick program with a simple GUI to save me the trouble.

Still use it to this day.
