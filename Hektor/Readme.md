My very first programming course final project. (With a friend)

Wanted to challenge myself and make a computer game, so I learned the concept of object orientated programming, learned how to use PyGame
and looked up a bunch of tutorials.

I am also resposible for the sprites.

I was (and still am) pretty proud of the final product and sometimes I still play it.
