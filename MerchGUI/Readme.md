After my first Python project, Hektor, I wanted to program something to benefit me. So MerchGUI came to be.

MerchGUI is a tool that helps the user to calculate and log Runecape merchanting profits. 

Runescape is a popular Online MMORPG, that I've played since I was a kid.

The game has a large economy and the items can be traded through in-game market. 
There is constantly a demand and supply for the many different in-game items, which makes 'flipping' and 'merchanting' possible.

Find an item - Get it's buy/sell prices - Buy cheap - Sell expensive. Simple!

MerchGUI makes it easier to calculate possible profits and logs the information in an excel file, so user can analyze the data later.

Helped me out a bit and it was definitely an interesting project.
